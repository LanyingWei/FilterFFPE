Description: This package finds and filters artificial chimeric reads 
    specifically generated in next-generation sequencing (NGS) process of 
    formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. These artificial chimeric 
    reads can lead to a large number of false positive structural variation (SV) 
    calls. The required input is an indexed BAM file of a FFPE sample.
